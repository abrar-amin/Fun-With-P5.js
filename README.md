When I taught myself programming back in high school, I enjoyed using P5.js to emulate random things, with varying degrees of success. 
Although I had many more files, I ended up deleting them sometime in junior year, but I did find my old P5.js account with some of my past programs. 
Additionally, I like to program solutions to homework PSETs whenever possible just to make sure my answers are somewhat reasonable. 


To run any of the files, paste the link commented in the first few lines of each program to open in P5.js. From there, press the play button, and it will begin to run the program.
