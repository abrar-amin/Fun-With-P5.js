When I taught myself programming back in high school, I enjoyed using P5.js to emulate random things, with varying degrees of success. 
Although I had many more files, I ended up deleting them sometime in junior year, but I did find my old P5.js account with some of my past programs. 
Additionally, I like to program solutions to homework PSETs whenever possible just to make sure my answers are somewhat reasonable.
